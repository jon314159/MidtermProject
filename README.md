# Command-Line Calculator

A fully interactive command-line calculator built in Python. This tool uses design patterns (Factory, Observer, Memento) and features a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) interface with undo/redo, history persistence, and configurable settings via environment variables.

## üì¶ Features

- Supports basic and advanced arithmetic operations  
- Maintains command and calculation history  
- Undo and Redo functionality using the Memento Design Pattern  
- Auto-saving history to CSV via Observer Design Pattern  
- Help, clear, save, and load commands  
- Input validation with custom exceptions  
- Modular and extensible design

## üîß Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jon314159/MidtermProject
   cd your-repo

    Set up a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Setup

    Create a .env file in your project root with the following:

    CALCULATOR_LOG_DIR=logs
    CALCULATOR_HISTORY_DIR=history
    CALCULATOR_MAX_HISTORY_SIZE=100
    CALCULATOR_AUTO_SAVE=true
    CALCULATOR_PRECISION=2
    CALCULATOR_MAX_INPUT_VALUE=1000000
    CALCULATOR_DEFAULT_ENCODING=utf-8

    These values control limits, storage directories, and output precision.

üöÄ Usage Guide

Start the calculator by running:

python -m app.calculator

divide a b	Divide a by b
power a b	Raise a to the power of b
root a b	Compute the b-th root of a
modulus a b	a modulo b
int_divide a b	Integer division of a by b
percent a b	b percent of a
abs_diff a b	Absolute difference between a and b
undo	Undo the last calculation
redo	Redo the previously undone calculation
history	Show command history

‚úÖ Testing Instructions

    Run unit tests

pytest

Show detailed output

pytest -v

Measure test coverage

    pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

üîÑ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

A basic workflow is included in .github/workflows/python-app.yml:

    Automatically runs tests on push and pull requests

    Ensures code integrity across Python versions

üìù Code Style

    All modules use type hints and docstrings

    Exceptions are meaningful and user-guiding

    Observer and Memento patterns are used for history and state management

    Environment-driven configuration (app/config.py)

üìÇ Logging

Ensure the logs folder exists or set CALCULATOR_LOG_DIR=logs in your .env.
You may configure logging in logger.py for info/warning/error levels.
